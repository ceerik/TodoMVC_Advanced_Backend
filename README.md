# TodoMVC_Advanced_Backend
Spring boot-based restful API for for interfacing between the TodoMVC_Advanced_Frontend and a MySQL database in which all important data is stored.

The calls available are the bare minimum required, with the addition of getItem for optimization purposes (one could otherwise hypothetically use getAllItems and iterate over them to get a specific item).  

Database columns:  
- id : int  
- todoText : String(140)  
- completed : binary(1)  
  
Other information such as viewState (showing all/active/completed items) are not stored as they do not contain any data relevant to each item, it's purely a view-focused sorting.  


## Available API calls (on localhost:8080 by default, also assumes a MySQL database on localhost:3306):
